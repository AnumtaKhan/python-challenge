Please see the details for my Financial Analysis for PyBank and PyPoll below. 

    PyBank: I have created a Python script to analyze the financial records of my company based on the budget_data.csv financial dataset. This script shows the following:
        Total number of months
        Net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period
        Changes in the Profit/Losses over the entire period
        Average of the changes above
        Lastly, the greatest increase and greatest decrease in profits over the entire period.
    
    PyPoll: This script shows the Analysis I have made for a small town with its vote-counting process.
    This script shows the following:
        Total number of votes cast
        All Candidates who received votes
        Percentage of votes won by each Candidate
        The Total # of votes won by each Candidate
        Lastly, the Winner of the election based on the highest # of votes

The analysis for both has been printed to the terminal and have been exported to a text file with results which is also attached.
